    "## Porject purpose\n",
    "In today's complex educational landscape, choosing the right school an dmajor can be a daunting task for sutdents and their families. To simplify this process and empower individuals with data-driven insights, we propose the creation of an Education Decision Support System. This system will leverage a comprehensive dataset of educational information to provide valuable guidance and visualization tools for informed decision-making. The purpose of the ducational decision support system is to assist students and their families in making well-informed choices regarding their education by harnessing the power of data analytics and visualization. The platform aims to achieve the following key objectives: \n",
    "<br> &emsp;&emsp;a. search a list or visualization chart of university based on the user's perspective \n",
    "<br> &emsp;&emsp;b. search a list or visualization chart of major based on the user's perspective\n",

    "<br> 2. National Center for Education Statistics (gov)\n",
    "<br> 3. Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes (PSEO) - Census (gov)\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "<br> Example 1: \n",
    "     <br> &emsp;&emsp;The user comes from a poor family from SD. They want to find a major that can be complete in 4 years and find a job in 1 year. \n",

    "     <br> &emsp;&emsp;1. change or select the mod to \"find a major\" \n",
    "     <br> &emsp;&emsp;2. change the filter options. location to SD, \n",
    "     <br> &emsp;&emsp;3. change sort by: % of instate employed (y1_grads_emp_instate / (y1_grads_emp + y1_grads_nme ))\n",

    "<br> Example 2: \n",
    "<br> &emsp;&emsp;The student wants to work in school system and get a better development potential. He doesn't consider pursuing a PhD. \n",
    "<br> Step: \n",
    "    <br>&emsp;&emsp; 1. use function to search cip code  which include \"school\" or \"university\" in description\n",
    "    <br>&emsp;&emsp; 2. change or select the mod to \"find a major\" \n",
    "    <br>&emsp;&emsp; 3. add filter cip-code: add / select all previous search result\n",
    "    <br>&emsp;&emsp; 4. add filter degree level: select associate, certificate, bachelor, master. \n",
